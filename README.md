# OneWeekChallenge

Its all too easy for hobby projects to never end.  We write them for fun.  Because we had an idea that in some way
appealed to us.  Feel of commerical constraints we can refactor & pontificate to our hearts desire.  Or we may start
something else.  But constaints can be a useful thing.  So in the sprit of _stop starting and start stopping_ this
project has one constraint.  One week, one project.

Got a good idea for a one week app?  File and issue and use the `idea` tag.
